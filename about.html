        <p class="lead">We're a trio of college students who each take a lot of
          quantitative classes. This website was created for VandyHacks 2020 - Summer Edition,
          with the goal of having many complex formula calculators all in one place and
          speeding up productivity for ourselves, as well as for others who use calculators
          on a daily basis.</p>

                  Chemical Engineering and pursue a minor in Computer Science. Outside of these areas, she also enjoys learning Spanish,
                  painting, and hiking. Mara was first introduced to programming in the spring of 2020 when she took an introductory Java
                  course, and she now hopes to learn more languages and expand her knowledge of CS. VandyHacks is her first hackathon, so she
                  is very excited to collaborate with her teammates and improve her web development skills!</p>

                  to later go into the tech/startup space. In his free time, he produces and posts his own original music and plays
                  ultimate frisbee as a member of the Williams College men's team. VandyHacks is his first hackathon, and he hopes to participate in many more in the

                  creativity, problem solving, and applicability of CS. In her free time, she enjoys photography, skateboarding,
                  exploring languages, and playing her traditional Chinese instrument. VandyHacks is Hangling's first Hackathon ever
                  (but many more to come), and she is so grateful for her awesome teammates and this exciting experience! </p>
